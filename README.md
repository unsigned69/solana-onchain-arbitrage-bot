# Solana On-Chain Arbitrage Bot

Supports intelligent routing and calculates optimal arbitrage routes. This is a Solana on-chain arbitrage bot that supports intelligent routing and calculates optimal arbitrage routes.

## 📝 Basic Introduction

This repository contains an arbitrage bot based on contract intelligent routing, which is divided into a client and a contract. This repository represents the client, with the following main functions:

- Retrieve trading pools for arbitrage.
- Automatically pair trading pools and assemble and submit trades.

Regarding the contract (contract address: DxeQQ7PQ94j26ism5ivTqNHAkteFNmgRpqYx7XQFqs9Z):

- Receive trading pools submitted by the client.
- Automatically calculate the optimal arbitrage path and the optimal input (if any), and initiate the arbitrage operation. Otherwise, the transaction will fail.

The currently supported trading pools will be continuously expanded in the future:

- PumpSwap
- Raydium AMM
- Raydium CPMM
- Raydium CLMM
- Meteora DLMM
- Meteora Dynamic Pools

> **For successful arbitrage trades using this arbitrage bot, a 10% fee of the profit will be charged. If the arbitrage fails or there is no profit, the contract will not charge any fees.** For example, if you input 0.5 SOL and output 0.6 SOL, the profit is 0.1 SOL, and the fee is 0.1 * 10% = 0.01 SOL.

## 🔧 Architecture Overview

The repository is organised into several top level folders:

- `core/` – stateless arbitrage engine orchestrating the flow
- `dex_adapters/` – one module per DEX implementing a common interface
- `contracts/` – on-chain program interaction code
- `config/` – configuration files and validation helpers
- `logger/` – centralised logging with daily rotation
- `utils/` – pure utility helpers
- `test/` – unit tests

### Adding a new DEX adapter

1. Create a class extending `DexAdapter` in `dex_adapters/`.
2. Implement at least `initialize(connection)` and `fetchPools(mint)`.
3. Optionally provide `createSwapTransaction(pools)` for transaction generation.
4. Instantiate your adapter in `start.js`.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Install the Environment

> Currently, only one-click installation on Linux systems is supported.

Execute the following command in the root directory:

```bash
bash install.sh
```

### Basic Configuration

The following configurations in `solana-onchain-arbitrage-bot/src/config.js` must be filled in. You only need to fill in either `screctKey` or `screctKeyBase58`.

```javascript
"base": {
    // RPC request URL
    "rpcUrl": "https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com", 
    // Wallet private key, an array of 32 numbers. Fill in either screctKey or screctKeyBase58.
    "screctKey": [], 
    // Wallet private key in Base58-encoded string. Fill in either screctKey or screctKeyBase58.
    "screctKeyBase58": "", 
}
```

### Convert SOL to Wrapped SOL (WSOL)

DEXs generally use WSOL for trading. Therefore, you need to convert an equivalent amount of SOL to WSOL in your account before starting the trading. Use the script provided in the repository to perform the conversion:

Execute the following command in the `src/tools` directory: `node warp_sol.js --amount=1000000000`

Here, `amount` is the amount of SOL in lamports.

To convert WSOL back to SOL, execute `node warp_sol.js --amount=1000000000 --close`

> Ensure that the converted amount is greater than the `maxInputAmount` field configured in `config.js`. The default configuration of `1000000000` represents 1 WSOL.

### Start the Bot

Execute the following command in the `src` directory:

```bash
node main.js
```

After starting, you will see the following log output:

```javascript

  ]
}
```

The message `Error Message: Not Profit.` indicates that the bot has started running normally. The `Not Profit` error occurs because the simulation has already determined that there is no profit to be made, so the transaction will not be actually sent. Only when the simulation succeeds will the transaction be sent.

If you want all transactions to be broadcasted to the blockchain, you can configure `bot: "skipPreflight": false,`. After this configuration, all transactions will be broadcasted. However, note that even if a transaction fails, you will still incur gas fees.

Dry run mode can be toggled without editing the config by setting the `DRY_RUN` environment variable to `true` or `false`:

```bash
DRY_RUN=true node start.js
```

> **Note**: If the user's intermediate token account (e.g., trump) for arbitrage does not exist, the bot will automatically create it. If it exists, please ensure that the account balance is zero.

## 🌟 Arbitrage Principle

For any two trading pools, if there is a price difference, it may be possible to profit from arbitrage. Assume that:

- In trading pool 1, you use `a` SOL to buy `b` tokens of token X.
- In trading pool 2, you sell `b` tokens of token X to get `c` SOL.
- The potential profit: `p = c - a`

If `p` is greater than 0, arbitrage is possible; otherwise, it is not.

For arbitrage involving multiple trading pools, the optimal arbitrage route needs to be calculated in advance, and then the arbitrage is carried out according to the optimal route.

Due to the contract's computational power limitations, currently only one-hop optimal path calculation is supported, i.e., SOL -> X -> SOL. The contract will pair all input trading pools in pairs, calculate the optimal arbitrage path, and then conduct arbitrage according to the optimal path. If no profitable path is found, no arbitrage will be carried out, and the contract will report an error, causing the transaction to fail.

## 📅 How to Build Trust?

Since the contract code is not open-source, concerns may arise, such as:

- Will my private key be uploaded?
- Can the contract owner transfer all my tokens?

To address these concerns, we take the following measures to ensure the safety of your assets:

**Regarding the first concern**: The client code is completely open-source. You can see that in the client code, the private key is only used for local transaction signing and will not be uploaded to any third party or read by the contract.

**Regarding the second concern**: The arbitrage contract code is not open-source. Without proper protection, the contract owner could potentially transfer your tokens. Therefore, we have open-sourced a [Guard Contract](https://github.com/touyi/guard_contract) repository. The principle is as follows:

In the arbitrage contract, according to the client code, the user's token accounts input to the arbitrage contract only include:

- SOL account (automatically included as the signer)
- WSOL account (`userTokenBase`)
- Intermediate token account for arbitrage (`tokenPair0UserTokenAccountX`)

In the arbitrage contract, only the balances of these three accounts can be transferred.

The "intermediate token account for arbitrage" should have a zero balance, so there is no risk of loss from this account.

For SOL and WSOL, the [Guard Contract](https://github.com/touyi/guard_contract) ensures that the total amount of WSOL + SOL after the arbitrage contract is called is greater than the amount before the call. Otherwise, the contract will fail, and the entire transaction will be reverted. This mechanism guarantees that you will not suffer losses in the arbitrage contract. For the specific implementation, please refer to the [Guard Contract](https://github.com/touyi/guard_contract) code.

### Using the Guard Contract

#### Using the Publicly Deployed Guard Contract

Contract address: `3SmBMUQe5QUpLc7wMrm97CRs3kXBSFtMZvPw8CDwZvUi`

Configure the contract IDL path in the configuration. Currently, there is an IDL file for the publicly deployed guard contract in the `idl` directory of this code repository, named `guard_contract.json`. You can directly configure it in `config.js` as follows:

```json
"base": {
    // RPC request URL
    "rpcUrl": "", 
    // Wallet private key, an array of 32 numbers. Fill in either screctKey or screctKeyBase58.
    "screctKey": [], 
    // Wallet private key in Base58-encoded string. Fill in either screctKey or screctKeyBase58.
    "screctKeyBase58": "", 
    // If using the guard contract for submission, fill in the IDL file path of the guard contract.
    "guardContractIDL": "../idl/guard.json",
}
```

#### Deploying Your Own Guard Contract

For deployment instructions, refer to the [Guard Contract](https://github.com/touyi/guard_contract) repository.

After successful deployment, the configuration is the same as above. Make sure to specify the IDL path of your own deployed guard contract.

## 💰 Advanced Usage (Custom Contract Calls)

This section is intended for users with some coding skills. You can implement your own client, assemble your own trades, and define your own token sending strategies to submit arbitrage transactions.

### Input Definition of the Arbitrage Contract

#### Account Input

```rust
#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct CommonAccountsInfo32<'info> {
    /// CHECK: NONE
    pub user: Signer<'info>, // Wallet address
    #[account(mut)]
    /// CHECK: NONE
    pub user_token_base: UncheckedAccount<'info>, // User's WSOL account
    #[account(mut)]
    /// CHECK: NONE
    pub token_base_mint: UncheckedAccount<'info>, // Mint address of WSOL: SOL111111111111111111111111111111111111111112
    
    #[account(mut)]
    /// CHECK: NONE
    pub token_program: UncheckedAccount<'info>, // Fixed: TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA

    #[account(address = anchor_lang::solana_program::system_program::ID)]
    /// CHECK: NONE
    pub sys_program: UncheckedAccount<'info>, // Fixed: 11111111111111111111111111111111

    #[account(mut)]
    /// CHECK: NONE
    pub token_pair_0_user_token_account_x: Option<UncheckedAccount<'info>>, // Intermediate token account for arbitrage
    #[account(mut)]
    /// CHECK: NONE
    pub token_pair_0_mint_x: Option<UncheckedAccount<'info>>, // Mint address of the intermediate token

    #[account(mut, address = RECIPIENT_PUBKEY)]
    /// CHECK: NONE
    pub recipient: AccountInfo<'info>, // Contract fee recipient account, fixed: B2kcKQCZUWvK59w9V9n7oDiFwqrh5FowymgpsKZV5NHu

    // The following are trading pool accounts, supporting a maximum of 29 accounts
    #[account(mut)]
    /// CHECK: NONE
    pub account_0: Option<UncheckedAccount<'info>>,
    #[account(mut)]
    /// CHECK: NONE
    pub account_1: Option<UncheckedAccount<'info>>,
    #[account(mut)]
    /// CHECK: NONE
    pub account_2: Option<UncheckedAccount<'info>>,
    ......
    ......
    #[account(mut)]
    /// CHECK: NONE
    pub account_27: Option<UncheckedAccount<'info>>,
    #[account(mut)]
    /// CHECK: NONE
    pub account_28: Option<UncheckedAccount<'info>>,
}
```

The input consists of two parts:

- **Basic Accounts (`accounts`)**: Fill in these accounts according to the above code.
- **Trading Pool Accounts**: These accounts are filled in according to certain rules. Here is an example of how to fill in the trading pool accounts using PumpSwap:

![image](https://github.com/touyi/solana-onchain-arbitrage-bot/blob/main/assets/pump.png)

For each trading pool, to call the CPI and complete a swap operation, the trading pool requires some input accounts. As shown in the figure above, the sell instruction requires 19 + 1 = 20 accounts (the additional account is the PumpSwap program account). Therefore, in the input of the arbitrage contract, 20 accounts (`account_0` - `account_19`) need to be reserved for the contract to fill in the input accounts of the trading pool.

In practice, you will find that many of these accounts are common accounts, such as the `user` account. These common accounts are filled in the basic accounts, while the trading pool accounts only need to fill in the accounts specific to the current trading pool, such as the `Pool` account. For specific implementations of different trading pools, refer to the fetcher implementations in the `solana-onchain-arbitrage-bot/src/pool_fetcher/` directory. For example, the fetcher implementation for PumpSwap is as follows:

```javascript
async getFillaccounts() {
    let input_accounts = [];
    input_accounts.push(this.pool_program);
    input_accounts.push(this.pool_key);
    input_accounts.push(this.global_config);
    input_accounts.push(this.base_mint_pool);
    input_accounts.push(this.quote_mint_pool);
    input_accounts.push(this.protocol_receiver);
    input_accounts.push(this.protocol_receiver_account);
    input_accounts.push(ASSOCIATED_TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID);
    input_accounts.push(this.authorith);
    input_accounts.push(this.coin_creator_vault_ata);
    input_accounts.push(this.coin_creator_auth);
    
    return input_accounts;
}
```

For each trading pool, simply fill in the corresponding accounts in this order. Multiple trading pools should be filled in the `account_xxx` fields of the arbitrage contract in sequence.

#### Parameter Input

The previous section explained how to fill in the trading pool accounts. However, when multiple trading pools are filled in the `account_xxx` fields, how does the arbitrage contract distinguish between these different pools and determine the type of each account segment? This is where additional parameter information comes in. The currently defined parameters for the instruction entry are as follows:

```rust
pub fn arb_process_32_account(
    ctx: Context<CommonAccountsInfo32>,
    max_in: u64,
    min_profit: u64,
    market_type: Vec<u8>,
    market_flag: Vec<u8>
);
```

There are four parameters:

- `max_in`: The maximum amount of WSOL to be used for purchasing, in lamports. This parameter limits the maximum input, and the actual input is determined through optimal calculation of the arbitrage path.
- `min_profit`: The minimum profit, in lamports. If the final profit of the transaction is less than this value, the transaction will fail.
- `market_type`: An array representing the types of trading pools. It describes the types of trading pools corresponding to the `account_xx` fields in the trading pool account section. Currently, different values represent the following:
  - 0: Meteora DLMM
  - 1: Raydium AMM
  - 2: PumpSwap
  - 3: Raydium CLMM
  - 4: Raydium CPMM
  - 5: Meteora Dynamic Pools
- `market_flag`: Information about trading pool processing. This field is a `u8` array, where each `u8` represents the processing information of a trading pool. Currently, only the highest bit is used, i.e., `(1 << 7) & flag`. If this bit is set to 1, it indicates that the corresponding trading pool is a **flipped pool**. The definition of a flipped pool is explained below.

#### Flipped Pools

The concept of flipped pools is introduced for convenient and unified abstraction. For all trading pools, each pool contains a trading pair of two tokens. For example, in the PumpSwap trading pair `5wNu5QhdpRGrL37ffcd6TMMqZugQgxwafgz477rShtHy`, the pool information usually records the mints of these two tokens. We refer to the first token as `Token_X` and the second as `Token_Y`, as shown below:

![image](https://github.com/touyi/solana-onchain-arbitrage-bot/blob/main/assets/Snipaste_2025-05-18_21-37-06.png)

`Token_X` is `Ce2gx9KGXJ6C9Mp5b5x1sn9Mg87JwEbrQby4Zqo3pump`

`Token_Y` is `So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112`

Since our current arbitrage support is limited to WSOL, we need to ensure that `Token_Y` in each trading pool is WSOL. If not, we need to flip the trading pool (the client does not flip the accounts during construction but simply passes an additional `market_flag` to indicate that `Token_Y` in this pool is not WSOL, and the contract will handle the flipping).

## 🛡 Production Monitoring

The bot runs a heartbeat that checks the Solana RPC and optional DEX endpoints.
Results are written to `logs/health-*.log`. When the check fails three times in
a row an **ALERT** level message is sent to Telegram. Recovery triggers an
**INFO** notification.

Add a `telegram` section to your configuration:

```json
"telegram": {
  "enabled": true,
  "botToken": "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN",
  "chatId": "CHAT_ID",
  "profitNotify": false
}
```

Message levels:

- **CRITICAL/ALERT** – engine crash, heartbeat failure or RPC outage
- **ERROR** – transaction or arbitrage problems
- **WARNING** – unusual but recoverable issues
- **PROFIT** – optional trade reports (enable with `profitNotify`)
- **INFO** – startup and recovery messages

## 🛠 Custom Error Classes

The core uses a hierarchy of errors to make debugging and recovery easier:

```
ArbitrageError
├─ ConfigError
├─ NetworkError
├─ DataError
│   └─ PoolFetchError
├─ TxBuildError
└─ ExternalApiError
```

`PoolFetchError` inherits from `DataError` and is thrown when a DEX adapter fails to fetch pools. `TxBuildError` indicates a failure constructing a swap transaction. `NetworkError` wraps RPC related issues and is retried with exponential backoff. Any unrecoverable error is passed to `handleFatalError` which logs it and sends an alert when `ALERT_WEBHOOK` is configured.

Example usage:

```javascript
import { PoolFetchError } from './utils/errors.js';

try {
  await adapter.fetchPools(mint);
} catch (e) {
  throw new PoolFetchError(adapter.name, e);
}
```

## 📌 Future Plans
- refactor by rust(doing)
- Support for Jito transactions
- Integration with Kamino
- Monitoring of high-volume tokens
